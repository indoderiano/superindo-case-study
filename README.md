## SETUP

in root folder, create file .env with data as formatted below


  REACT_APP_API=http://localhost:4000
  REACT_APP_LOCALSTORAGE_KEY=superindo

we will use 
http://localhost:4000
because this is default server url

you can use your own key and replace data 'superindo' in above example

npm install
npm start

make sure to register your own account in order to access the app as customer
